# Sentiment-classification
Coursework project using Pytorch. It involved sentiment classification using hierarchical model. Involved NLP techniques such as word embedding using Skipgram and character-based word embedding created using RNN in first layer, and Bi-LSTM model in second layer to predict the classes. Evaluation was done using accuracy and f1 scores.
